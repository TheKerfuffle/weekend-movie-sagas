    [  ] - When a movie poster is clicked, a user should be brought to the `/details` view for that movie.

    [ x ] - Have a way to get to the Add Movie Page

[  ] - This should show all details 
        **including ALL genres** for the selected movie.

    [  ] - You will need to store this data in redux!

    [  ] - The details page should have a `Back to List` button, 
        which should bring the user to the Home/List Page

    [  ] - a dropdown (for the genres)
    BUTTONS
    [  ] - `Cancel` button, which should bring the user to the Home/List Page
